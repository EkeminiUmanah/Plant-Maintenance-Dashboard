# Maintenance Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
Excel-based maintenance analytics dashboard demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, KPI tracking, and visual reporting for maintenance operations.

## Purpose
Built this project to demonstrate understanding of maintenance management metrics and Excel analytical capabilities relevant to maintenance planning and CMMS data analysis roles.

## Features

### 1. Work Orders by Status (Pie Chart)
- Visual breakdown of work order distribution
- Shows: Completed, In Progress, Planned, Cancelled
- Helps identify backlog and workflow bottlenecks

### 2. Maintenance Type Distribution (Bar Chart)
- Analyzes completed work orders by maintenance type
- Categories: Preventive, Inspection, Corrective, Breakdown, Overhaul
- Critical for understanding preventive vs reactive maintenance ratios

### 3. Top 10 Equipment by Downtime (Horizontal Bar Chart)
- Identifies equipment with highest downtime hours
- Enables prioritization of problem equipment
- Supports reliability improvement initiatives

### 4. Monthly Maintenance Cost Trend (Line Chart)
- Tracks maintenance spending over time
- Identifies cost patterns and seasonal variations
- Supports budget planning and cost control

## Data Structure
Dashboard uses realistic oil & gas maintenance data including:
- 30 equipment items (pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, etc.)
- 500+ work orders spanning 12 months
- Equipment metrics (MTBF, MTTR, availability)
- Cost tracking (labor + materials)
- Downtime recording

## Technical Implementation
- **Built with:** Microsoft Excel
- **Key Features:** Pivot Tables, Advanced Formulas, Conditional Formatting, Dynamic Charts
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data visualization, KPI tracking, analytical thinking

## Key Metrics Tracked
- Total work orders by status
- Equipment availability and uptime
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
- Preventive vs breakdown maintenance ratios
- Maintenance costs by equipment/type
- Work order completion rates

## Relevance to Maintenance Planning
This dashboard demonstrates:
- Understanding of maintenance KPIs and terminology
- Ability to analyze work order data for insights
- Excel proficiency for planning and reporting
- Visual communication of complex operational data
- Systematic approach to identifying problem areas

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real CMMS/SAP PM data
- Automated data refresh capabilities
- Drill-down functionality for detailed analysis
- Resource utilization tracking
- Schedule compliance metrics
